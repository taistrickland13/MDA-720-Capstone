I hope it's not too much trouble to fix, but that's pretty hampering to accessibility and efficiency as things stand now.

On a lesser note, if there were some to make the notifications not all clear away from the Notification Center when only one of them is being selected, that would further help in the name of efficiency. Some apps, I notice, wipe clean the notifications from the Notification Center the moment the app is opened or reentered, whereas some don't mess with them at all, save for removing the ones tapped on/swiped left. When you've backed dozens upon dozens of campaigns that are still actively updating, it can be such a slog skimming through the Activity Log, especially if you're more interested in reading certain updates first. Notifications are ideally a quick and easy way to flip everything new to find the info/content you're most interested in at the present moment.

The app makes it intuitive and easy and even (gently) reminds you when projects/opportunities are about to expire, to insure you don‚Äôt accidentally miss out on something you showed interest in. Transactions have been 100% safe and secure; and you can even use PayPal and Apple Pay! You DO have to wait a bit longer than when you‚Äôre shopping at a store because this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúshopping‚Äù - it‚Äôs investing (a.k.a. ‚Äòbacking‚Äô here on KS) so you‚Äôre helping the designer to fund the manufacturing process. The discount is your reward for helping THEM bring their vision to reality. If you‚Äôre an impatient millennial then this may not be the thing for you; BUT if you have a little dollop of patience in your persona, and enjoy being on the cusp of new trends, you‚Äôre going to LOVE Kickstarter!

The whole Covid nightmare and the supply chain issues it‚Äôs spawned HAVE caused a few minor delays on a couple of projects I‚Äôve backed. I just want to be honest here.

One thing is allowing the user to pinch and zoom into listings. Sometimes there are pictures that are difficult to see in portrait mode. Sure, you can sort of zoom in, but you have to keep both fingers on the screen in order to keep the picture where you want it. Even then, one needs to move the picture around in order to keep focused. Of course, this wouldn‚Äôt be a huge concern if landscape mode didn‚Äôt block out most of the content on the page, necessitating the use of portrait. Another issue is that the app just doesn‚Äôt have the same filters to see projects that the website does. There‚Äôs currently no way to see upcoming projects unless they‚Äôve already been bookmarked. And speaking of bookmarks, I use the same bookmarked searches EVERY TIME I‚Äôm on the app. Why then do I manually have to go through Kickstarter‚Äôs default views EVERY TIME when I only want to see the views I‚Äôm interested in?  The last issue is really with Kickstarter itself, not specifically to the app, but this seems like the best forum with which to lodge a complaint. I‚Äôve sometimes preordered or backed things post-campaign, so even though I missed the campaign itself, I‚Äôm very interested in following the updates because they concern me, too. Yet, even though I bookmark the campaign page, I don‚Äôt see the updates in my feed or email. I manually have to go back and check those pages now and then to see the latest.

996,2022-10-12 10:31:29,"The app works in as far as the features it includes. Recently I was kicked out of a campaign I was really excited about due to a major error on Kickstarter‚Äôs part, the lack of reliable and accessible rectification of payment through the app. The system Kickstarter has in place for rectification is broken due to the fact that nothing they have in place for rectification of payment can be used in the app as far as my case is concerned. Perhaps my case is special, I don‚Äôt know. But everything I tried, that Kickstarter suggests, failed. 

Am I angry? Yes. Therefore I will keep this brief. My suggestion to all using the app is - Do not back/fund anything that is just about to close unless you know for a fact your payment has gone through! They will not run your payment twice. The seven day rectification period ends with the campaign and does not continue as Kickstarter seems to think it does. In addition, jump on any first emails you receive about rectification of payment! It didn‚Äôt help me, but it‚Äôs the only chance you have if you are really attached to the project. I should have gotten more emails then the single email I received, there should have been at least two. Make sure you can log in on the website, it may help where there are features not mirrored in the app for this as well‚Ä¶ not that they helped me, but hopefully it will help someone. 

At this point I have been told by Kickstarter that ‚Äúit‚Äôs eleven days past‚Äù which is all the time it has taken for me to figure out what has been typed above.

I also wind up backing a lot of TTRPG dice projects even though I absolutely do not ever need yet another d20! No matter your Interest you‚Äôll find something cool on Kickstarter. 

This app is handy and it works quite well. I‚Äôve no hesitation at all in recommending the app to others. That being said, I would like for the app developers to add a function that will remove old projects from the Saved tab. Once a Kickstarter is either successfully funded or fails to be funded there‚Äôs no reason for it to remain in my Saved tab. I just find it annoying to have to go back to every project to click the heart again to remove it from my Saves. The Search function also isn‚Äôt great - if I search for Call of Cthulhu why does it show me projects that were funded some times literally years ago? Obviously it‚Äôs waaaayyy too late to back those projects. 

I also think that the app could use some fine-tuning to make it more direct. What I mean by that is there should be categories like Table-Top Role Playing Games, Playing Cards, Knitting Patterns (I dunno what it would be called; I don‚Äôt knit), Bird-Watching, Knives, Calendars, and so forth and such. The Recommended For You tab often has good projects that the app knows I would be interested in because of prior projects that I‚Äôve backed, but there‚Äôs also a lot of projects in Recommend that I wouldn‚Äôt ever be interested in.

Of the unsuccessful ones about 30% were outright scams and about 10% failed along the way for numerous reasons (unrealistic goals, faulty manufacturing, copyright infringement, inability to mass produce, etc). The most important thing to remember with Kickstarter (KS) is caveat emptor: the principle that the buyer alone is responsible for checking the quality and suitability of goods before a purchase is made i.e. you assume all the risk. In the event that a KS campaign is fraudulent and the creators either do not bring the campaign to market or the campaign is an outright scam KS will do nothing to come to your aid and sadly I have lost, like others, substantial amounts of money with no recourse. In an ideal world KS is here to help projects come to life that otherwise wouldn‚Äôt with the help of good intended souls in exchange for goods that otherwise people won‚Äôt have. In reality, there are many campaigns, especially in the technology section, that are either unrealistic or complete scams that are cringeworthy.

By far, going to the Kickstarter website on your device is much much better than this app. In fact, using this app (especially when making comments to campaigns) makes things worse for others. Let me list the worst things about this app and explain how this app makes the Kickstarter experience worse for everyone (whether they use the app or a browser).

1. In this app, comments are sorted by most recently posted whether it is an original post or a reply to a someone else‚Äôs post. So if there‚Äôs a post shows up at the top of the list that says ‚ÄúThey have said that this will not happen‚Äù you have no idea what they are referring to. On the website version of Kickstarter, posts are sorted and grouped by thread, meaning original post first with more recent replies underneath it. This way, that reply above makes sense when you see the original question ‚ÄúWill they being offering this product in red?‚Äù
2. There is no way to correctly reply to a comment, so if you try to answer someone‚Äôs question by saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù it will show up in comments as a seemingly random ‚ÄúYes‚Äù original post by you but no one will know what you are answering or make them think you‚Äôre having a should-be private moment. THIS MAKES EVERYONE‚ÄôS KICKSTARTER EXPERIENCE WORSE, because comments from app users often have no context.
3. There is no way to search text in this app. This also makes everyone‚Äôs experience worse because you are more likely to ask a question that someone already asked recently. On the website, you can easily search FAQs, reward content, and comments (to a point because they don‚Äôt have a dedicated search feature but its still more than the app offers)
4. There is no easy way to click on a FAQ link like the website has. Instead, you have to go to the campaign page and manually scroll down for what feels like forever in order to get to the FAQ. This discourages its use (to the point that some people don‚Äôt even know an FAQ exists) and again makes everyone‚Äôs experience worse because people will ask questions that have already been addressed in the FAQ.

I love Kickstarter and have backed over 470 campaigns. I‚Äôm at a point where the danger of this app is such that a 1-star review is warranted. I strongly urge you to not download the app or use Kickstarter at all. Apple should remove this from the App Store. 

Why?

Because Kickstarter has NO legitimate customer service. The company is mismanaged where there is no guarantee anyone from customer service will respond to you and they do not have any phone number to call. There is no accountability and community rules and expectations are either not enforced or selectively enforced. The whole system is set up to protect creators of projects at all costs even if that means protecting a fraudster. A creator can run off with a campaign‚Äôs money and nothing can be done. Kickstarter set things up to not be helpful at all -they might reply with vague platitudes or not at all, you can ONLY report a problem once and only once no matter if new problems arise. Kickstarter will not give any information on how to reach a creator who has disappeared. They refuse to help in any way unless you get a lawyer and even then no lawyer will help anyway because Kickstarter terms are designed to prevent any restitution. Even if the fraud is clear, Kickstarter will take the side of fraud and fight against you with your credit card company if you report the fraud. 
I know Kickstarter - I‚Äôm a super backer per Kickstarter - so believe me when I say run like hell from this until Kickstarter gets fixed. Apple you too have an obligation to police your App Store- please take action because Apple users will continue to be victims of fraud when using Kickstarter.

The nightmare begins when you are randomly booted back to the main menu. Slide down to the category you were in and you'll find that you are now at the start of the list of projects - and the list is no longer sorted the same as it was before you were booted out. This will happen randomly, but often enough that you'll quickly find yourself wondering how in the world anyone would actually release such a horrible excuse for an app. The visual side of this app is great, but the user experience is so dramatically and utterly BAD that I can only assume that there was zero beta testing performed on this before it was published.

I've found it to be difficult to tell (if you are looking for new projects) if they are sorted how you would.

The bad: removed list of rewards from home page; now I can't see how many are left for limited rewards; that reward page is terrible and I've always avoided it even in the old app and now it's the only way to back something; side scrolling is awful; you removed the countdown on current projects in my Backed list; there is no Categories Wheel on my page anymore (and I've never been able to click on it to sort even in the old app); the navy blue background isn't pretty and doesn't look good with the lime green; For some reason the previews of updates are in a sans serif font and then full updates are in a serif font, which, I mean, come on guys...

When you open the project you can no longer see the rewards immediately. You must Open the ""reward"" link only to find that you have in fact opened the ""back this project link"" instead. In the old version when I went to my profile I used to immediately see if I had any unread messages. Now, I have to go to the separate messages link to get that same information. I don't understand why people who create changes to apps think that making something more difficult will make us like it more.

1234,2016-11-28 21:07:15,"Just some feedback.  The new app version looks pretty much like a big step backward to be honest.  
1) Everything has no color, it's all just a plain lifeless white, the old blue background was certainly better.
2) The new top to bottom format with 2 projects per row being viewed on ""backed projects"" and ""saved projects"" is horribly unfriendly.  The previous view of a sliding left to right view was more appealing and more user friendly (and also seemed to allow for additional information to be seen which leads to #3)
3) And this is the most important one that I think needs an update fast (like within 48 hours) now the projects I have backed on the backed projects page don't show funding amounts or time remaining which is extremely useless!  That is what that page is for, to give you the important information on what you have backed or saved, the time remaining and the funding amount/% are the two most important pieces of data that showed in that page, and now you may as well just have a typed list of names and no pictures even because that view is useless.

I could easily live with #1 and #2 (although the color thing is annoying the new view makes things too small), but #3 is a paramount issue that removed one of the most important functional uses of the app.  It needs to be fixed ASAP!

1. All links in a campaign open up in this app - they don't go to Safari, etc. which wouldn't be a problem except it almost NEVER works. You stare at the Kickstarter app loading screen until you give up. You end up having to use the sizing bars back at the campaign page and try to copy the link to a browser. 

2. There is a feature that allows the category to be sorted by 'magic'. It's BLACK magic if you ask me. :) Under this option, a number of the campaigns repeat in the list, so you're looking at the same 4 over like 3 times before it goes to the next ones - then it happens again. Ugh.

3. My favorite is - you've spent 15 min browsing down the list of campaigns in a category. You close the campaign you're looking at... You realize for no reason you're in a completely different category! Why?! Now you have to scroll through a hundred campaigns in your previous category (or a THOUSAND if you're sorting by (black) Magic) to get to where you were.
