To my great astonishment and with humblest appreciation I not only reached my financial goal but surpassed it nearly doubling my initial specified goal amount.  While I am not yet completely out of the proverbial woods, the funding and support I have received from those I know combined with total strangers from all points around the globe, I have found myself affording basic necessities food and even temporary dwellings, thus giving me a new lease on life and the ability to begin to start again.

1,2021-09-10 06:41:41,"I am very happy with my experience with GoFundMe.  Honestly, the only reason I didn’t give you 5 stars is because of 1 single problem.  That being the fact that there isn’t a way to call and speak to someone if you run into an issue.  I had an issue with my password and got locked out for a little while.  Of course there is the regular “forgot password”, but for some reason it just wouldn’t work for me causing me to become very frustrated to the point of just giving up for a week or so.  

Thankfully, when I went back to try again, it worked just fine. HOWEVER, at that point, we had a difficult time setting up withdrawals and never really figured out why except the specifics bank was not one to choose from. Thankfully there was a way to do it manually by just putting in the bank account info.  Then at that point, we were told it would take 2-5 business days to transfer the money, which I understand. However, if we had known that a little earlier, we could have done it before the bill we needed to pay came due.

Honestly, some of these problems may have been “user error”, but, if I had been able to speak to a person, they could have walked me through it and alleviate my anxiety.

My only wish is that there was some way to help get your “message” or “wish” or “fund” more out there and seen than just sharing.

Dear, Go Fund Me Creators
I want to take this moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for your generous contribution to help me with my financial situation and everyone else’s hardships and crisis. The kindness and support mean the world to me, and I cannot thank you enough.

I want you to know that your platform to allow these donations has not gone unnoticed, and I am truly humbled by the outpouring of support from people, friends, and complete strangers you’ve opened to help me in this difficult situation. In the past, I have been hesitant to ask for help due to my pride and ego, but my journey of recovery has taught me the importance of being honest about my circumstances.

 

 I am already overwhelmed by the support I have received, and it is a great comfort to know that there are people out there like you (GoFundMe) in this world who are willing to help those in need. 

Your kindness has made a significant impact on my life, and I am deeply grateful for it.

Once again, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your generosity and support as an application that truly helps those in need of financial assistance. I hope that someday I can repay your kindness in some way, but until then, please know that I will always be grateful for what you have done for me.

I wish the fees weren’t so high. I feel like there’s a better way they could handle those. People are asking for help because they need the money they are asking for. It’s too bad they couldn’t base those fees off of income levels. My niece provided for her mother and was her caretaker until the very end. Every penny in donations would have helped tremendously. Her mom’s disability check was helping her with rent and she’ll no longer have that help on top of having to pay for a service for her mom and provide for her daughter as a single mother. Hopefully after all of this she’ll be able to get back to working full time again. I’d give 5 stars if it wasn’t for the fees.

99,2019-06-04 11:27:05,"GoFundMe takes a percentage of each dollar donated, understandably you have to pay employees and make money as well, but I believe many beneficiaries of these accounts truly need every dollar donated to them. 
For instance, the account I started for a dear friend of mine, has made roughly $6000, thus far with $200+ going to GoFundMe. But it doesn’t stop there
Although I know this seems petty, my account beneficiary needs every penny, as he can no longer walk. 
In my opinion, GoFundMe should charge a one time fee $50 or so, for each account opened. Or maybe, give the option to pay a one fee “to open a account” or “open the account for free”but have a percentage taken out, like it’s done now. (For people that don’t have money to pay upfront) Just a thought. 😊🤷🏼‍♀️

1) no banks seem to have heard of them. As a result, a donation from a family friend was marked as potentially fraudulent by her bank. She had to get an entire new card and this disrupted her use of her account as a result. It was easier simply to allow the chargeback and have her donate again with her new card. Challenging it would have taken up to 2 months. 

2) my bank (Wells Fargo) refused me access to my funds, because they had never heard of WePay, and didn't trust its legitimacy. I had to wait an extra few days to access them, forcing me to use other credit card to cover expenses related to the campaign.
